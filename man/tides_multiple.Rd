\title{Calculate TIDES test for multiple sets of values}
\usage{
tides_multiple(
  mean,
  sd,
  n,
  min,
  max,
  n_items = 1,
  digits,
  calculate_min_sd = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean}{numeric variable representing the reported mean.}

\item{sd}{numeric variable representing the reported Standard Deviation.}

\item{n}{numeric variable representing the reported sample size.}

\item{min}{numeric variable representing the variable's minimum possible/observable score.}

\item{max}{numeric variable representing the variable's maximum possible/observable score.}

\item{calculate_min_sd}{logical variable representing whether a minimum SD should also be calculated. This should only be calculated if the varible is not only trucated (has a minimum and maximum possible/observable score) but also the variable is discrete/binned/granular: ie the response must be whole numbers (e.g., a 1-7 likert scale, where an indiviudal cannot provide a score of 1.5).}
}
\value{
a tibble containing the max and min SD and a summary variable \code{result} indicating if the tested values are consistent or not.
