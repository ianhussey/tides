# Regression: plot_sd_bounds() used to infer the mean-grid spacing from
# median(diff(curve$mean)). sd_bounds_curve()'s grid is deliberately not
# uniform - it adds every kink of the 1/(n * n_items) lattice plus a pair of
# neighbours 1e-9 away - so once the kinks outnumber the uniform grid (about
# n * (u - l) > 333 at the default `by`) the median fell BELOW the plain grid
# spacing. band_polygon() then read every ordinary interval as a gap and the
# feasible region was drawn as thousands of one-column slivers instead of one
# band. sd_bounds_curve() now records the spacing it used and plot_sd_bounds()
# reads it.
