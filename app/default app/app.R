# ---- bound curves -----------------------------------------------------------

# sd_bounds_curve() is the package's own envelope, and it is what draws the
# curve wherever it can. Two cases it does not cover:
#
#  - attained extremes, for which it has no argument;
#  - a wide scale with a large n, where its grid has a point at every kink of
#    the floor's sawtooth (the 1/(n * items) lattice). At 0-100 with n = 200
#    that is 60,001 evaluations and 23 seconds, far more resolution than a
#    460-pixel panel can show and slow enough to make the app look hung.
#
# In both, the same grid is walked through sd_bounds() directly - thinning the
# kinks to CURVE_MAX_KINKS in the second case - and the POMP columns rebuilt
# exactly as sd_bounds_curve() builds them, so either branch returns an object
# plot_sd_bounds() and plot_sd_bounds_pomp() can draw. Only the drawing is
