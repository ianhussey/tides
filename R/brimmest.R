#' BRIMMEST: certify whether a reported (mean, SD) is attainable
#'
#' Bounds-Related Inconsistency of Means and Errors, Settled Test. An exact
#' possible / impossible certificate for reported summary statistics on a
#' bounded integer scale, obtained without reconstructing any dataset.
#'
#' `brimmest()` completes the family, and the superlative is the point.
#' [brim()] and [brimmer()] — like GRIM and GRIMMER before them — test
#' conditions that are *necessary but not sufficient*: failing one proves a
#' report impossible, but passing them all proves nothing. A handful of tuples
#' clear the SD bounds, GRIM and GRIMMER together and still correspond to no
#' integer dataset.
#'
#' `brimmest()` is *necessary and sufficient*. It enumerates the exact
#' attainable `(mean, sd)` lattice for the design by dynamic programming over
#' the reachable `(sum, sum of squares)` states, rounds that lattice to the
#' reporting precision, and asks whether the reported tuple is a member. The
#' verdict is therefore exact in both directions: a hit means some integer
#' sample on `[l, u]` of size `n` rounds to exactly this report, so it is
#' **possible**; a miss means no such sample exists, so it is **impossible** —
#' a proof, not a heuristic flag. Nothing in the GRIM family can make the
#' second claim.
#'
#' The three tests are nested, cheapest first:
#'
#' | test | asks | verdict |
#' | --- | --- | --- |
#' | [brim()] | is the reported mean attainable? | necessary only |
#' | [brimmer()] | and is the reported SD attainable with it? | necessary only |
#' | `brimmest()` | is the pair jointly attainable by real integer data? | necessary and sufficient |
#'
#' This is the same question the CLOSURE algorithm answers (see
#' `unsum::closure_generate()`), reached analytically rather than by search —
#' an *analytic CLOSURE certification*. The trade is that no witness datasets
#' are produced: the lattice records which `(mean, sd)` pairs are reachable,
#' not how. In exchange the cost depends only on `l`, `u` and `n`, not on how
#' many datasets happen to satisfy the constraints. The certification
#' validation document in `validation/` reports the comparison against CLOSURE
#' in full.
#'
#' @section How the work is done:
#' Two routes reach the same verdict, chosen automatically by design size.
#'
#' For a small design the whole attainable lattice is enumerated once and the
#' reports matched against it, so a vector of tuples costs barely more than a
#' single one. The lattice is cached per `(l, u, n)`, so repeated calls on one
#' design pay for it once.
#'
#' For a large design asked about a handful of reports, enumerating everything
#' to answer a membership question is wasteful — and on a wide scale it is
#' impossible, since the state table outgrows `max_cells`. A reported tuple
#' pins both coordinates almost completely: the mean's rounding interval
#' admits only a few integer sums, and each of those pins the sum of squares
#' to a narrow window. That reduces certification to a question about one
#' sample sum at a time, which is answered in three escalating steps.
#'
#' A closed-form sandwich comes first. For a given sum the achievable sums of
#' squares lie between the clustered configuration and the Structure-S one,
#' and all share the sum's parity; a window meeting no admissible integer
#' between them is impossible on arithmetic alone. What survives goes to a
#' constructive search over non-increasing samples — the partitions of the sum
#' — with the same sandwich re-applied at every step to what is left to place.
#' Reaching a complete sample proves possibility and produces a witness;
#' exhausting the search proves impossibility. Only when neither happens
#' inside `search_budget` does the corridor sweep run: a dynamic program
#' confined to the states that can still reach a target, roughly a tenth of
#' the full table.
#'
#' The practical effect is that designs the lattice refuses outright become
#' answerable — a 0-63 inventory at `n = 50` needs a 3151 x 24801 table — and
#' that the overwhelming majority of single reports are settled without any
#' sweep at all.
#'
#' @section Rounding and the direction of proof:
#' A hit certifies possibility under whichever rounding rule produced it. A
#' miss certifies impossibility only *relative to the rules in `rounding`*,
#' because a report unreachable under one convention may be reachable under
#' another. The default takes the union of `"half_up"` and `"half_down"`,
#' which spans the usual ambiguity about how a source rounded its halves.
#' Narrow it only when the source's convention is actually known: certifying
#' against one rule when the paper used another manufactures a false
#' impossibility. Note that unlike [brimmer()] there is no `"up_or_down"`
#' option, since rounding the lattice forward needs a definite direction.
#'
#' @param l,u Numeric scalars, the scale limits. Integer-valued (in mean-score
#'   units when `n_items > 1` and `scoring` is `"meanscored"`).
#' @param n Integer scalar, sample size.
#' @param mean,sd Numeric vectors of reported means and SDs, recycled against
#'   each other. All are certified against one lattice.
#' @param digits Integer, the reported decimal places, used for both `mean`
#'   and `sd` unless the next two are given.
#' @param mean_digits,sd_digits Integer scalars or NULL; reported decimal
#'   places when the mean and SD are reported to different precision.
#' @param rounding Character vector of rounding rules to admit, from
#'   `"half_up"`, `"half_down"`, `"native"`, `"ceiling"`, `"floor"`,
#'   `"trunc"`, `"anti_trunc"`. A tuple is possible if it is reachable under
#'   any of them.
#' @param scoring "singleitem" (default), "sumscored", or "meanscored".
#' @param n_items Positive whole number of response items (default 1).
#' @param max_cells Guard on the dynamic program's state space (default
#'   `2e7`); the enumeration errors rather than exhausting memory above it.
#' @param search_budget Node budget for the constructive search (default
#'   `2e5`). Raising it lets the search settle more reports on its own;
#'   lowering it hands them to the corridor sweep sooner. The verdict is the
#'   same either way — only which route produces it changes.
#' @return A data.frame with one row per reported tuple: `mean`, `sd`,
#'   `possible` (logical), and `rules` — the rounding rules under which the
#'   tuple is reachable, comma-separated and `""` when none.
#' @seealso [brim()] and [brimmer()] for the closed-form screens to run
#'   first, and [sd_region_data()] for the lattice itself.

# ---- Batch certification -----------------------------------------------------

#' Certify many reported (mean, SD) rows exactly
#'
#' Applies [brimmest()] to each row of a data frame. Columns of `data` whose
#' names match [brimmest()] arguments are taken per row; any argument given in
#' `...` is a constant broadcast to every row. Supplying one name both ways is
#' an error. The counterpart of [brimmer_multiple()] for the exact test.
#'
#' Rows are **grouped by design** and each group certified in a single
#' [brimmest()] call, which is the whole point of the function: one attainable
#' lattice serves every report of a design and is built once, so certifying a
#' 200-row table on one design costs barely more than certifying one row of it.
#' Repeated `(mean, sd)` pairs within a design are computed once and reused.
#' Row order is preserved.
#'
#' Recognised per row (column or constant): `l`, `u`, `n`, `mean`, `sd`,
#' `digits`, `mean_digits`, `sd_digits`, `scoring`, `n_items`.
#'
#' `rounding`, `max_cells` and `search_budget` may be given only as constants,
#' never as columns. `rounding` is a *set* of admitted rules rather than one
#' value per row, and the other two are cost controls on the call; passing any
#' of them as a column is an error rather than a silent per-row reading.
#'
#' @param data A data frame, one reported statistic set per row.
#' @param ... Constant arguments applied to all rows.
#' @param include_inputs If TRUE (default), returns `data` column-bound to the
#'   results; if FALSE, only the result columns (same row order), for drop-in
#'   use inside a `dplyr::mutate()` / `purrr` pipeline.
#' @return A data frame with `possible` (logical) and `rules` (the rounding
#'   rules under which the row is reachable, comma-separated and `""` when
#'   none), optionally with `data` prepended. Unlike [brimmest()], the reported
#'   `mean` and `sd` are not echoed back: they are already columns of `data`
#'   when supplied that way, and repeating them would collide.
