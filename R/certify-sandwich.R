# Fast-path certification for brimmest(): decide one reported tuple by
# arithmetic and a pruned constructive search, rather than by sweeping a state
# space whose size is set by the design.
#
# Both existing routes -- the full attainable lattice and the targeted
# corridor DP in R/attainable-target.R -- answer "which states are reachable?"
# and then read the answer off. That is the right shape for a grid of reports
# and the wrong shape for one. This file answers the membership question
# directly, in three layers of increasing cost, and hands back to the corridor
# DP only when the third is cut short.
#
# Everything here works on the shifted integer scale y = mg * (x - l), so
# y is a whole number in [0, W] with W = mg * (u - l), and
#
#   S = sum(y)      the sample sum, pinned to a few integers by the mean
#   Q = sum(y^2)    the sum of squares, pinned to a window by the SD
#
# Layer 1 -- the sandwich screen, O(1) per candidate sum. For a given S the
# achievable Q values lie between the clustered configuration (.q_min_int,
# every value on the two integers around the mean) and the Structure-S
# configuration (.q_max_int, as many values as possible at the top of the
# scale). They also share S's parity, because y^2 = y (mod 2) makes
# Q = S (mod 2) for every sample. A window that meets no integer of the right
# parity inside that sandwich is impossible, decided in microseconds.
#
# Layer 2 -- a constructive search over non-increasing value sequences, which
# is to say over the partitions of S into at most n parts of size at most W.
# Each node re-applies the layer-1 sandwich to what is left to place, which
# prunes hard: near either wall of the scale the surviving tree is a handful
# of nodes, so those cells (where the closed-form screens leak, and where the
# known blind-spot cells sit) are settled outright.
#
# Layer 3 -- the same search run to exhaustion. Reaching a leaf is a proof of
# possibility and yields a witness sample; exhausting the tree is a proof of
# impossibility. Only when neither happens within the node budget is a verdict
# withheld, and then the corridor DP supplies it.
#
# Two structural choices keep the tree small. Requiring the sequence to be
# non-increasing collapses the n! orderings of a sample to one, and reflecting
# y -> W - y whenever the sum sits above the midpoint means the search always
# builds from the nearer wall, where the partition tree is shallow. A third
# keeps it usable: the search is depth-first on an explicit stack rather than
# recursive, since it is one level deep per observation placed and a sample
# size in the thousands would otherwise exhaust R's evaluation depth long
# before the node budget bit.
