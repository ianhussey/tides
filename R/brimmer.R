# ---- Layer 5: report-level consistency check ---------------------------------

#' BRIMMER: check a reported (mean, SD, n) against the SD bounds
#'
#' Bounds-Related Inconsistency of Means and Errors Reported. The SD-side
#' bounds test, and the package's main entry point: it asks whether a reported
#' standard deviation is arithmetically attainable given the scale limits, the
#' sample size and the reported mean. [brim()] is the mean-side test, which
#' needs no SD.
#'
#' The report-checking wrapper above [sd_bounds()]: give it the reported
#' summary statistics as they appear in a paper (numeric values plus their
#' reported decimal places), and it unrounds them, computes the bounds
#' envelope, runs the applicable consistency tests, and returns a single
#' consistent/inconsistent verdict with the reasons.
#'
#' BRIMMER is nested on top of BRIM, exactly as GRIMMER is nested on top of
#' GRIM: it applies the mean-side test and then adds the SD-side one. A report
#' is consistent only if every applicable test passes, and each names a
#' distinct defect.
#'
#' Tests applied (each only when its inputs are present):
#' * `in_scale_range` — the BRIM predicate: can the reported mean's rounding
#'   interval meet the feasible mean band at all? Bounds only, independent of
#'   granularity; with attained extremes the band narrows (see
#'   [feasible_mean_band()]). Run by [brim()] on its own.
#' * `bounds` — does the reported SD's own rounding interval overlap
#'   `[min_sd, max_sd]`? (The package's validated mathematics.)
#' * `feasibility` — a residual: the constraint set admits no sample for a
#'   reason none of the other tests already accounts for, such as an alpha
#'   floor exceeding the alpha ceiling. An out-of-range mean reports as
#'   `in_scale_range` and a granular-impossible one as `grim`, so neither
#'   double-counts here.
#' * `grim`, `grimmer` — scrutiny's verdicts, deferred verbatim (only under
#'   `Z = "integer"` with `rounding`). NOTE scrutiny's GRIMMER (and, under
#'   `rounding = "up"`, GRIM) have documented floating-point boundary bugs,
#'   including false flags under the default rounding. When GRIMMER is the ONLY
#'   failing test, the note says so explicitly, since that pattern matches
#'   the documented false-flag family.
#'
#' `consistent` is TRUE iff every applicable test passes. `failed_tests`
#' names the failures (empty string if none).
#'
#' Unlike [sd_bounds()], `rounding` here defaults to `"up_or_down"` — a
#' report-checking context virtually always deals with rounded values. Pass
#' `rounding = NULL` to treat the inputs as exact instead (digits then
#' unused).
#'
#' @param l,u Numeric scalars or NULL, logical limits.
#' @param a,b Numeric scalars or NULL, observed (attained) extremes.
#' @param n Integer scalar, sample size.
#' @param mean Numeric scalar or NULL, the reported mean.
#' @param mean_digits Integer scalar or NULL, its reported decimal places
#'   (required when `mean` and `rounding` are both given).
#' @param sd Numeric scalar or NULL, the reported SD — the thing being
#'   checked. NULL runs the mean-side tests only, which is what [brim()]
#'   does; the SD columns are then `NA`.
#' @param sd_digits Integer scalar or NULL, its reported decimal places
#'   (required when `rounding` is given).
#' @param rounding Rounding rule for unrounding the reported values
#'   (default `"up_or_down"`); NULL treats inputs as exact. See
#'   [unround_interval()].
#' @param Z "continuous" (default), "integer", or "quasiinteger".
#' @param scoring "singleitem" (default), "sumscored", or "meanscored".
#' @param n_items Positive whole number of response items (default 1).
#' @param alpha Numeric scalar or NULL, reported Cronbach's alpha.
#'
#' @return A one-row data.frame: `consistent` (logical), `failed_tests`
#'   (comma-separated names, "" if none), then the [sd_bounds()] columns
#'   `min_sd`, `max_sd`, `feasible`, the BRIM predicate `in_scale_range`, then
#'   `grim`, `grimmer`, `sd_in_bounds`, the
#'   percent-of-maximum-possible transforms `pomp_mean`, `pomp_sd_parity`
#'   (linear, against the mean-agnostic parity ceiling) and `pomp_sd_sharp`
#'   (position within the sharp mean-conditional band), and `note`.
#'
#' @seealso [brim()] for the mean-side test, [brimmest()] for the exact
#'   certificate that settles what this test can only screen, and
#'   [brimmer_multiple()] to apply this across a data frame.

#' BRIM: check a reported mean against the scale bounds
#'
#' Bounds-Related Inconsistency of Means. The mean-side test: is the reported
#' mean attainable at all, given the scale limits, the sample size and, when
#' supplied, the attained extremes? Where GRIM asks whether a mean is
#' attainable by strictly integer data at a given `n`, BRIM asks whether it is
#' attainable within the reporting range at all — a weaker condition that
#' applies to continuous data too, and one that tightens sharply once an
#' observed minimum or maximum is reported.
#'
#' A thin wrapper on [brimmer()] with no reported SD, so only the mean-side
#' tests apply: `in_scale_range` (the reported mean's rounding interval must
#' meet the feasible mean band, see [feasible_mean_band()]) and, under
#' `Z = "integer"` with `rounding`, scrutiny's `grim` verdict. GRIMMER is never
#' invoked, and the SD-side columns are omitted rather than returned as `NA`.
#'
#' The two tests are independent and name different defects: a mean can be out
#' of range but granular-attainable (7.50 on a 1-7 scale at `n = 30`), inside
#' the range but GRIM-impossible (3.51 at `n = 30`), or both (7.51).

#' defined at every mean, so the curves have no gaps — unlike a strict-integer
#' floor, which exists only at GRIM means. Returns raw bounds and their
#' parity-normalised counterparts for the POMP plot.
#'
#' @param l,u Numeric scalars, limits.
#' @param n Integer scalar, sample size.
#' @param Z granularity; `"quasiinteger"` (default) gives a hole-free floor.

#' @return A data.frame: `mean`, `min_sd`, `max_sd`, `feasible`, `pomp_mean`,

#'   The `"step"` attribute records the uniform grid spacing `by` actually

#'   cannot be recovered from the returned means, and a consumer that needs to
