# Targeted reachability for brimmest(): certify ONE reported tuple without
# enumerating the whole attainable lattice.
#
# .attainable_lattice() answers "which (mean, sd) pairs are reachable?" and
# then brimmest() asks whether the report is among them. For a single report
# that is a membership question answered by a reachability-of-everything
# computation, and on a wide scale the full lattice is not merely slow but
# refused outright by its own size guard: a 0-63 inventory at n = 50 needs a
# 3151 x 24801 state table.
#
# The report pins both coordinates almost completely, which is what this file
# exploits:
#
#   * the mean's rounding interval admits only integer sums S in
#     [n*(m_lo - l), n*(m_hi - l)] -- usually one to a few values, not
#     thousands (this is the GRIM condition, read as a constraint rather than
#     a test);
#   * each candidate S then pins the sum of squares to a narrow window,
#     because Q = S^2/n + (n - 1) * sd^2 and sd is known to its reporting
#     precision.
#
# So the question becomes: can n integers in [0, W] hit one of a handful of
# (S, Q-window) targets? Three consequences:
#
#  (1) The reported values are inverse-rounded to intervals once, instead of
#      the lattice being forward-rounded cell by cell for every rounding rule.
#  (2) States that cannot reach any target are never visited. A partial sum s
#      after t items is viable only if the remaining k = n - t items can still
#      carry it to some target sum, and likewise on the R axis, which confines
#      the DP to a corridor around the targets rather than the full rectangle.
#  (3) A hit can be declared the moment it appears, at any layer: an item with
#      value y = 0 adds nothing to either coordinate, so a target reached
#      after t < n items pads out to exactly n with scores at the scale
#      minimum. Possibility is therefore often near-instant, while
#      impossibility still costs a full sweep of the corridor -- asymmetric,
#      but in the useful direction.
#
# The verdict is identical to lattice membership; only the work differs. That
# equivalence is asserted cell for cell in tests/testthat/test-brimmest.R.

# Internal: how many cells would the full lattice need? Mirrors the arithmetic
# in .attainable_lattice() without allocating anything, so brimmest() can
# choose a route before committing to one. NA when the design is not on the
# integer grid at all.
