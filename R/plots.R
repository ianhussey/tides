#' Plot SD bounds on the native scale
#'
#' The feasible SD band (floor to ceiling) against the mean, optionally with
#' reported points coloured by consistency (green/red outlined dots).
#'
#' `shade = "outside"` (default) shades the infeasible region and leaves the
#' feasible one clear, matching [plot_sd_bounds_pomp()] with
#' `reference = "sharp"`, so the two scales read the same way: shaded means
#' unreachable. `shade = "inside"` fills the feasible band instead, which was
#' the behaviour before this argument existed.
#'
#' @param curve Output of [sd_bounds_curve()]. Its `"step"` attribute, when
#'   present, is the mean-grid spacing used to tell a sampling gap from a
#'   genuine one under `shade = "outside"`; a curve built by hand, without that
#'   attribute, should be on a uniform grid, from which the spacing is inferred.
#' @param points Optional data.frame with `mean`, `sd`, and (optionally)
#'   `consistent`; e.g. the output of [brimmer_multiple()].
#' @param title Optional plot title.
#' @param fill,line_colour Band fill and outline colours. `fill` is used only
#'   by `shade = "inside"`; the infeasible shading has its own fixed grey.
#' @param shade `"outside"` (default) shades the infeasible region;
#'   `"inside"` fills the feasible band.
#' @param expand Padding around the plotted region, as a proportion of the
#'   scale width `u - l` rather than a fixed number of SD units, so that the
#'   margin looks the same on a 1-5 scale and a 0-100 one. Applied to both
#'   axes. The limits always stretch to include `points`, so an out-of-bounds
#'   report is never clipped out of view.

#' Plot the umbrella grid
#'
#' Renders the reportable `(mean, sd)` tuples of a design, in either of two
#' styles. Optionally overlays the bound curves from [sd_bounds_curve()].
#'
#' `style = "points"` (default) greys the whole panel and draws only the
#' consistent tuples. Nothing else is drawn, because nothing else exists: every
#' other cell of the grid is a value that cannot be reported. This matches the
#' convention of [plot_sd_bounds()] and [plot_sd_region()], where shading marks
#' what is ruled out, and it makes the real structure legible — the vertical
#' striping at means an integer sum can round to.
#'
#' `style = "tiles"` draws every cell of the reporting grid, coloured as
#' consistent, GRIMMER-inconsistent, or out of bounds. That is useful for
#' methods exposition, since it separates what the bounds rule out from what
#' GRIMMER additionally rules out, but it inverts the emphasis: at
#' `n = 14` on a 1-7 scale at two decimal places it spends two thirds of its ink, in the most
#' saturated colour, on impossible tuples, and GRIMMER's verdict alternating
#' between adjacent SDs produces interference banding that obscures the striping.
#'
#' Note what the points represent. The consistent set is the GRIM- and
#' GRIMMER-consistent one, which is what [brimmer()] applies. It is strictly
#' larger than the set of attainable tuples, so an umbrella plot shows what the
#' test admits rather than what exists; use [brimmest()] to certify a tuple.
#' The gap is not always small — 9\% at `l = 1, u = 5, n = 10`, and nearly a
#' factor of three at `l = 0, u = 6, n = 23` with two items.
#'
#' @param umbrella Output of [umbrella_data()], or an already-filtered lattice
#'   from `sd_region_data(rule = "integer")` — anything with `mean` and `sd`,
#'   filtered by `consistent` when that column is present.
#' @param curve Optional [sd_bounds_curve()] output to overlay as bound lines.
#' @param title Optional plot title.
#' @param style `"points"` (default) or `"tiles"`; see Details.
#' @param point_colour,point_size Point appearance. `point_size` defaults to a
#'   value chosen from the number of points, since a size that reads well for a
#'   few hundred is a solid mass at twenty thousand.
#' @param reference_colour Colour of the overlaid bound curves.
